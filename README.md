# Gomoku with TDD

**The Three Laws of TDD**

1. Do not write any production code without a failing test first
2. Write only enough test code as is sufficient enough to fail 
3. Only implement a minimal code that makes the failing test pass.

## Getting Started
### Tomato 1  
- Start with  a board 
### Tomato 2 - Simulator sadness
- test should run in any order
